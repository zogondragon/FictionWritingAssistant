# FictionWritingAssistant
Fiction writing assistant app for GNOME 3

## Key Requirements
* The app should fully support unicode for almost every major language.
* The app should properly handle issues, chapters, parts, volumes, works and series.
* The app should maintain conceptual models (e.g. plot items, events, characters, factions, relationship graphs) and present beautiful visualization of models to assist the writers.
* Utility functions such as Random Name Generators or Random Event Ideas will be useful.

## Key Technical Considerations
* The app should distinguish the engine and the UI for multi-platform adaptation of future.
* App data should be stored in XML or JSON files with unicode support. 
* Formatter should be able to support various file formats, but for now plaintext output is sufficient.

## Main Use
* For my own writing.
* GUI app development practice for GNOME3 on Centos or Fedora.
